# neural-network-from-scratch

This python program gives the basics one has to know about how to build an neural network from scratch. The data used here is taken from nnfs module and number of classes are assumed 
to be three. The loss function we have used is categoricalcross entropy which is used in multiclass classification.
optimization as of now is not done in this program but will be uploaded shortly 
This neural network is the most basic one as it has only 2 layers with 2 feature input and one ReLU activation layer and a softmax activation layer.
